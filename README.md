**We made the entire city of Toronto searchable with over half a million objects. Whether you're looking for street art, violet flowers, rusty bridges, or even some benches next to a tree (cool benchmark right?) - we've got you covered!**

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: We scraped all of Google Street View images for Toronto.
2. **AI-Powered Captioning**: Leveraged Gemini Flash to generate captions for each image.
3. **Embedding & Search**: Utilized Cohere's powerful embedding technology to make everything searchable.
